    <h2>A simple recipe for a simple food</h2>
    <p>Who doesnt love some cheesy macaroni? Heres a great recipe for your next cholesterol binge</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Tip</h5>
    <p>You can never have enough cheese, and I usually add an extra half cup without ruining the recipe. Keep a careful eye on the milk when boiling, as milk boils fast and burns easily. Burnt milk will show up in the recipes flavor if overcooked.</p>
